Constant Precipitation through out the year ranging between 4.7 - 6 inches (120mm to 160 mm)<img alt=\"means_ClimateGraph\" src=\"my_figures/ClimateGraph_with_means.png\"/>So the data from our analysis is in complete agreement with standard outside analysis.</p>\n",

The standard deviation is so low and constant in Summers which means the whole region have equal high temperatures through out the years.  \n",
