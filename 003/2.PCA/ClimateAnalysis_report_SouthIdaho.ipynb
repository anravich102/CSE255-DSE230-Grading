    "### 1) Importance of snow depth and temperature analysis of Southern Idaho \n",
    "South Idaho regiona has a characteristic of very few inches of rain every year. This was noticed in precipitation which is  almost same throughout the year with minimal variation.  Hence household in this region considered to be living in desert with not much drinking water. Primary source of drinking water is snow fall during winter. From literature, typically snow water equivalent (SWE) is a common snow pack measurement that is used to understand amount of water contained with in the snowpack. Every year, to predict availability of water for next year is a great need and analysis of snow depths along with temperature is required. A good prediction requires good statistical analysis which in this report is explored through PCA. Inaddition to prediction of drinking water, analysis should help to detect climate changes that should help initiate necessary corrective measures. \n",

    "From the previous plots, we have noticed that precipitation remains constant thorughout the year with not much variation. There is not statistical analysis that could be performed on that measurement. But snow depth has a good trend with the season. Hypothesis before further statistical analysis had is that snow depth has a strong correlation with TMin. Variations of the snow depths is in accordance with variation in TMIN measurement. \n",

    "In this section, we wanted to study statistical significance tests based on correlation between different measurements. For this study, focused analysis based on measurements from one single station. Station with good enough measurements where data from all the measurements is available is consider. Another factor considered is to find a station that could be true representative of this south idaho region. Station and its location on map can be identified based on the lat/Long information. In this case, used a reference below to identify its location. \n",

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "Based on our statistical significance test using correlation and PCA analysis, we have noticed few observations as listed below: \n",
    "- There is not much change in precipitation through out the year. Hence larger dimensions are required even in projected coordinate system. \n",
    "- Snow depth has a strong correlation with minimum temperature\n",
    "- Not much variation of average TMIN and SNWD in last 3 decades in this region of interest. \n",
    "- Performing statistical analysis using PCA technique, we observe that SNWD is described by first few principle components. Around 80% of the SNWD is captured with just one eigen vector. With 3 eigen vectors, 90% of the information is captured. Hence performing recontruction with these top 3 principle components, most part of target signal is reconstructed with very little residual. \n",
    "- Precipitation on the contrary required large number of dimensions. \n"
