    "We initially focused on six measurements:\n",
    "* **TMIN, TMAX:** the daily minimum and maximum temperature.\n",

    "* **SNOW:** Daily snowfall (in mm)\n",
    "* **SNWD:** The depth of accumulated snow.\n",

    "However, we decided to shift our focus more to the analysis of the daily snowfall (SNOW). \n",
