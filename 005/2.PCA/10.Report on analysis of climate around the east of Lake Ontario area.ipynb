    "#### Our focus of the six measurements are as follow:\n",
    "* **TMIN:** Daily minimum temperature (tenths of degrees Celsius)\n",
    "* **TMAX:** Daily maximum temperature (tenths of degrees Celsius)\n",
    "* **TOBS:** Temperature at the time of observation (tenths of degrees Celsius)\n",
    "* **PRCP:** Daily precipitation total (tenths of mm)\n",
    "* **SNOW:** Daily snowfall total (mm)\n",
    "* **SNWD:** Snow depth (mm)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional features are:\n",
    "* **STATION:** is the station identification code.  Note that the first two characters denote the FIPS country code, the third character is a network code that identifies the station numbering system used, and the remaining eight characters contain the actual station ID.\n",
    "* **LATITUDE:**   is latitude of the station (in decimal degrees).\n",
    "* **LONGITUDE:**  is the longitude of the station (in decimal degrees).\n",
    "* **ELEVATION:**  is the elevation of the station (in meters, missing = -999.9).\n",
