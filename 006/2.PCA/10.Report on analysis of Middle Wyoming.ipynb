    "Using Principal Component Analysis, we break the data down into significant eigenvectors. The goal is that we can capture the essential elements of a dataset with a few very significant eigenvectors. This does not mean that we are selecting the best features and discard the res. PCA computes new eigenvectors for the entire set to help represent all data. A second, and equally important goal of PCA is reconstruction, making new eigenvectors of the eisting data allows us to constrct a new dataset very similar to the existing one. This is why quality for all data is important, as bad data affects constuction.\n",
