It is likely to be hard to find correlations between the amount of rain on the same day in different stations. Because amounts of rain vary a lot between even close locations. It is more reasonable to try to compare whether or not it rained on the same day in different stations. As we see from the graph below, among 828638 days in our region with records, it rains in about 78% of the days.\n",
