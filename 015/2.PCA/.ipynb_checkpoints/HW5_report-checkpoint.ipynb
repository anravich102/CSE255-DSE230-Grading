According to US-Climate-Data the average rainfall is closer to 4.308 inch per month along the Miami Beach. However, there is clear agreement that in the trend of precipitation throughout the year. There is a gradual increment of precipitation from January to June, and between June and September there is siginificant rainfall, and from October to December, there is a gradual decrement in precipitation.</p>\n",

    "The top 5 eigenvectors explain 6.9% of the variance for PRCP, however the top 5 eigenvectors are able to explain 100% of the varience for SNOW and SNWD. More specifically, the top 2 eigenvectors can expalin the all the varience for SNWD and the top 3 eigenvectors are able to explain all the varience for SNOW.\n",
    "\n",
    "The huge difference of varience expalined between PRCP and SNOW/SNWD indicates that there are too much varience for precipitation throughout the year, so 5 eigenvectors are far more enough to capture the hugh varience of precipitation. But in contrast, there are little snow in the region and the snow is concetrated in the first quarter of the year, so 2 to 3 eigenvectors are enough to capture the varience in snow analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore in order to do some more interesting analysis, we will dig deeper into the PCA analysis for TOBS, which is the average temperature for each day. The TMIN's and TMAX's variences are harder to capture compared to the TOBS because the averaged temperature for a day is more consistent from day to day. The top 5 eigenvectors can explain 50% of the varience of TOBS, we want to look can we do a better job in explaining the TOBS."
