    "# Georgia-Alabama Region Weather Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a report on the historical analysis of weather patterns in an area that roughly overlaps the region of the USA states of Georgia and Alabama.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will use here comes from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). Specifically, it was downloaded from This [FTP site](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We focused on six measurements:\n",
    "* **TMIN, TMAX:** the daily minimum and maximum temperature.\n",
    "* **TOBS:** The average temperature for each day.\n",
    "* **PRCP:** Daily Percipitation (in mm)\n",
    "* **SNOW:** Daily snowfall (in mm)\n",
    "* **SNWD:** The depth of accumulated snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checking Valid Counts\n",
    "\n",
    "We first check the distribution of valid counts for various measurments over different months in the year. Following are the graphs showing Valid Counts for TMIN, TMAX, SNOW, SNWD, PRCP\n",

    "\n",
    "It is obvious that the distribution of valid counts is not uniform. In particular, we observe that valid counts for SNWD in the winters drops a lot - this is probably because of the difficulty of measuring snow depth in cold - which is probably a manual procedure, at least historically.\n",

    "<p>We observe that High closely follows the pattern of our TMAX Mean, being as low as 15 degrees celcius during winter months and rising to around 33 degrees celcius during peak summers. Also, the Low closely follows the pattern of our TMIN mean, being around 20 degrees celcius in the peak summer and dropping to around 3 degrees celcius during peak winters. .</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>Now, lets compare the precipitation. This website has given the precipiation data in terms of milimeters per month. According to the website's graph, we see that the precipitation fluctuates between 60mm to 120 mm per month. This translates to around 2 mm to 4 mm of daily rainfall. This closely follows our pattern of PRCP Mean which is clearly fluctuating between 2.00 mm/day to 5.00 mm/day. In addition the pattern of fluctuation closely resembles that of the provided graph.</p>\n",

    "### Percentage of variance explained.\n",
    "![VarExplained1.png](r_figures/r_VarExplained1.png)\n",
    "We see that the top 5 eigen-vectors explain 22% of variance for TMIN, 48% for TOBS and 20% for TMAX.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude that of the three, TOBS is best explained by the top 5 eigenvectors. This is especially true for the first eigen-vector which, by itself, explains 40% of the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![VarExplained2.png](r_figures/r_VarExplained2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 5 eigenvectors explain 7% of the variance for PRCP, 52% for SNOW, 82% for SNWD. The value for PRCP is very low, on the other hand, values for SNOW and SNWD are quite high, with the value for SNWD being the highest. This shows that top 5 eigenvectors are able to capture most of the variance in SNOW and SNWD signals but not PRCP signals. Before we try to analyze this, lets first look at the general Snowfall trends in this region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weather of Georgia-Alabama region being considered is such that it receives little to no snowfall. We can see the SNOW and SNWD MEAN+-STD plots below which show that it snows very very little in this region, compared to USA average.\n",
    "![r_SNOW_SNWD_Mean_STD.png](r_figures/r_SNOW_SNWD_Mean_STD.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it means that the Snow is close to zero almost throughout the year with little snowfall in the winter months. So, given this relatively simple trend of SNOW and SNWD, it is being explained very nicely by the top 5 eigen vectors.This implies that SNOW and SNWD have a very low dimenional pattern. Also, since SNWD is a decaying integral of SNOW and, as such, varies less between days and between the same date on different years, it is being captured the best - with the top 5 eigen vectors explaining as high as 82% of the total variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "PRCP, on the other hand has a more complex pattern, with fluctuations throughout the year and less obvious high level patterns. In other words, it is much more noisy that SNOW or SNWD. Hence, we see that the top 5 eigen vectors are able to explain only 7% of the variance in the case of PRCP. We would need more eigen vectors in this case to explain considerable amount of variance."
