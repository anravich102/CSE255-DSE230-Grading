    "On the other hand, as shown in the  **SNWD**  plot the top 5 eigenvectors explains 83% of the variance . This means that these top 5 eigenvectors out of 365 alone capture most of the variation in the snow signals which motivates to dig deeper into the PCA analysis for snow-depth to get more insight."
