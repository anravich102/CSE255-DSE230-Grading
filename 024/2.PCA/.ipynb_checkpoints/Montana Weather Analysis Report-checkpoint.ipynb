The above condition clearly is not satisfied in our case, so we can perform PCA on TDIFF. </p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>From the above analysis, we can see that with top 5 eigenvectors explaining about 25% of the variance, we can still reconstruct the plot of TDIFF, at least the shape of it.  Also, although given the whole part of data of TMAX and TMIN, the variance explained does not improve much, because TMAX and TMIN matrix does not commute with each other.  During the implementation stage, I notice some bug in the function Decompose (cell 23) in my code.  So I mannually rewrite the function using normal Python without spark feature, which lowers the speed of code during that part, but code still successfully achieves the goal of computing.  </p>"
