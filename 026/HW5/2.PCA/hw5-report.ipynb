Each row has several attributes, such as latitude, longitude, measurement, station, year, label, and vector. Each vector is 365-dimensional, which represents the data for a year (365 days).\n",

    "In this section, I will display the mean and standard deviation for each meansurement. The following two pictures show the mean and standard deviation of TMIN and TMAX. From the figure, we can see that the mean temperature is higher in the summer and lower in the winter, and the maximum temperature is much higher than the minimum temperature, which make sense.\n",

    "Therefore, we can conclude that of the three, TOBS is best explained by the top 5 eigenvectors.

    "First, I have displayed the mean and top 4 eigenvectors in the following pictures.

(The only difference is the first eigenvector is below 0, while the mean is above 0. This makes no difference because the shapes are similar, and we can use a negative coefficient for the first eigenvector during reconstruction.) The interpretation of this shape is that eig1 represents the overall amount of snow above/below the mean, but without changing the distribution over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "eig2, eig3, and eig4 are similar in the following way. They all oscilate between positive and negative values. In other words, they correspond to changing the distribution of the snow depth over the winter months, but they don't change the total snow depth too much. And they can be interpreted as follows:\n",
    "- **eig1**: overall amount of snow above/below the mean.\n",
    "- **eig2**: less snow in the end of March and beginning of April, more snow in Janurary.\n",
