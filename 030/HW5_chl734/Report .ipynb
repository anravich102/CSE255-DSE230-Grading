    "The top 5 eigenvectors explain 8.5% of the variance for PRCP and 15.6% for SNOW. Both are low values. On the other hand the top 5 eigenvectors explain about 88% of the variance for SNWD. This means that these top 5 eigenvectors capture most of the variation in the snow signals. Based on that we will dig deeper into the PCA analysis for snow-depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes sense that SNWD would be less noisy than SNOW. That is because SNWD is a decaying integral of SNOW and, as such, varies less between days and between the same date on diffferent years."

Therefore, there are very few stations with the snow pattern.\n",

    "In this report, we take a deeper look at the weather data for Tuscon and its nearby area. We examine the dataset using exiting source. Based on PCA analysis, we choose to look closer at Snow Depth (SNWD) patterns at the area, only to find out that the pattern is not shared commonly in this region, but only some mountains where they snow. And then we find out that the weather varies more between stations than differet years. At last, we look at the precipitaion (PRCP), precisely the spatial relationships of stations on the map, and also find clusters using rependency matrix.\n"
