The first eigenvector explained most compared to other eigenvectors so that it is a dominant eigenvector. The shape of it means that amount of snow above or below the Mean depending on the coefficient before this eigenvector. It is because when doing reconstruction using **eig1**, we need to use $$c0=Mean+Coeff1*eig1$$ which is used to adjust mean through Coeff1 and eig1. If Coeff1 is positive, it means drag Mean down(because **eig1** is below Mean) and vice versa.\n",

RMS has reduced nearly 400 for both cases. However, for Coeff2, RMS reduces a lot, that is 238, after mean-by-year than that, which is 27, after mean-by-station. It is same with Coeff3 where RMS reduces 204 after mean-by-year while 53 after mean-by-station.

    "## Correlation between stations for PRCP\n",

It can be transfered into the question that in what probability we can find oberserved the result when the null hypothesis is true where null hypothsis is 'the rainfall in the two locations is independent'. This probability is exactly the P-value. For example, when in m=1000 days, it rains in station1 for 500 days(n1=500) and it rains in station2 for 500 days(n2=500). If it rains in both stations for 500 days(l=500), under our null hypothesis, we should have a very low P-value for observing this l=500. In another case, if l=250, we should expect a high P-value. In an intuitive way, l=500 means these two stations are highly correlated while l=250 means they may be uncorrelated. Therefore, lower P-value corresponds to higher correlation and vice versa.\n",

In this plot, more pairs of stations have lower positive p-value which means most of them are not related with each other in the case of raining. However, there's a high frequency when positive p-value equals 0.4, which means that there are indeed some pairs of stations having a high correlation. It's highly possible for them to rain in both station on same day. A matrix of original scaled P-value is plot above to further verify this conclusion.\n",

In this whole area, the highest elevation is 2731.0 while the lowest is 1289.3, which is not a small difference. Therefore, the analysis of the influence from elevation on measurements worthes a try.  So I plot a following graph.\n",

We see that in the high elevation, from 2000 to 2800, total rainy days are around 120 while in the lower elevation(below 2000), the data is concentrated around 80 days/year. It means that when elevation is lower than 2000, the area rains not much and rains about 80days/year while in higher elevation about 2000, the area rains more frequently. What about the amount of snow(SNOW)?\n",

Since the overall temperature won't change much in this small region and max value can reflect the characteristic of climate, picking up max value makes sense.\n",
