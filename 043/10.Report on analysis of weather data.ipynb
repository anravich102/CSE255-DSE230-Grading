Using the inner product is too noisy, because you multiply the rainfall on the same day in two locations and that product can be very large - leading to a large variance and poor ability to discriminate. An alternative is to ignore the amount of rain, and just ask whether it rained in both locations. We can then compute the probability associated with the number of overlaps under the null hypothesis. We state our null hypothesis as the observed overlap is not statistically significant and the alternate hypothesis is that it is statistically significant.\n",

    "In the above graph, greater the significance, more is the correlation between the stations. We have around 180 stations which have maximum correlation which is because their p-norm was calculated with themselves. Apart from this, pair with higher correlation are less.\n",

    "The matrix above shows, for each pair of stations, the normalized log probability that the overlap in rain days is random. We see immediately the first 25 stations and 50-62 have very high correlation with each other. To find more correlations we use SVD (the term PCA is reserved for decomposition of the covariance matrix). As we shall see that the top 10 eigenvectors explain over 70% of the square magnitude of the matrix.\n",

    "Next, we reorder the rows and columns of the matrix using one of the eigenvectors, and as the following plot shows, the grouping of the stations becomes more evident. The lower right corner of the third matrix. The stations at positions 160-180 are clearly strongly correlated with each other. Similarly, the upper left corner of 4th matrix shows strong correlation between stations 0-25. In the other matrices, we see more sparse correlation between the stations\n",
