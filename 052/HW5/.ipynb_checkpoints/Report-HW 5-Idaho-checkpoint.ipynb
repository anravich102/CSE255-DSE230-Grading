The minimum temperature varies from around **10째 F** to below **50째 F** which is also pretty similar.\n",

    "1. From the first data source, precipitation is as high as 90 mm/month = **3 mm/day** to as low as 10 mm/month =**0.33 mm/day**. From the second data source, precipitaion ranged from 2 inches/month = **1.7 mm/day** (high) to  0.1 inches/month = **0.09 mm/day**. We see that our data also follows these ranges from the figure above.  \n",
