Since it very very rarely snows in Florida, there is not much samples (only 2 stations in my case) to analyse the data regarding SNOW and SNWD. On the other hand, for PRCP, we cannot use PCA for further analysis as the top 5 vectors can only explain about 6.7% of the total variance. One of the alternatives is to apply PCA based on stations rather than days. As a result, we'll further explore by applying PCA based on stations for analysis of PRCP.\n"

    "It is likely to be hard to find correlations between the amount of rain on the same day in different stations. Because amounts of rain vary a lot between even close locations. It is more reasonable to try to compare whether or not it rained on the same day in different stations. As we see from the graph above, in our region it rains in about one third of the days.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring statistical siginificance\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find a statistical test for rejecting the null hypothesis that says that the rainfall in the two locations is independent. Using the inner product is too noisy, because you multiply the rainfall on the same day in two locations and that product can be very large - leading to a large variance and poor ability to discriminate. An alternative is to ignore the amount of rain, and just ask whether it rained in both locations. We can then compute the probability associated with the number of overlaps under the null hypothesis.\n",

    "We observe that the there are lot of pairs with probabilty greater than 0.05. So, we can reject null hypothesis for those stations. But we can also find fair amount of pair of stations for which we cannot reject null hypotheis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating the normalized log probability for each pair of stations\n",
    "The matrix below shows correlation between each pair of stations. We see one big cluster of correlated stations in the plot, implying that the first 50 stations are highly correlated. In this big cluster, there are 4 darker clusters (stations between 0-10, 10-25, 25-35, 35-55), showing a greater correlation.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Finding structure in the dependency matrix\n",
    "To find more correlations we use SVD (the term PCA is reserved for decomposition of the covariance matrix). As we shall see that the top 10 eigenvectors explain about 77% of the square magnitude of the matrix.\n",

    "\n",
    "When we reorder the rows and columns of the matrix using one of the eigenvectors, the grouping of the stations becomes more evident. For example, consider the upper left corner of the scond matrix (The upper left one). The stations at positions 0-22 are clearly strongly correlated with each other. Even though there are some stations, in positions 0-5 or so, which are more related to each other than to the rest of this block. This type of organization is called Block Diagonal and it typically reveals important structure such as grouping or clustering. You might want to extract the sets of stations that form blocks for your region, and then plot them on the map to see their spatial relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data on Maps\n",
    "The figure below shows the stations with very similar (both magnitude and sign) coefficients. This means they have similiar weather patterns over different days. One possible inference we can make out this is that, since these stations are very close to the Atlantic Ocean on the map. So, they have similar weather patterns even tough they are geographically separated.\n",

    "I analysed three major measurements snow depth, TOBS and Precipitation in this report. We see that variation of snow depth and TOBS can be explained better by performing PCA on number of days. But, since, there was not much data for SNWD and SNOW in the region of Florida, PCA could not reveal much information in this case, but a thorough analysis has been done for TOBS. This is beacuse the variation of these measurements are temporal. However, the variation of precipitation can be explained better when we perform PCA on different stations."
