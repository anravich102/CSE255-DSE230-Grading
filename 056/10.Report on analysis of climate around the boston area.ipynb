    "<p> We initially see a lot of big spikes in our data, particularly from early and later years. These early spikes are likely resulted from very little data being collected initially, thus resulting in readings far from actual averages. Through the early 1900s, more and more measurements are taken and we can see more consistent readings. However, the deployment of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_airport_weather_station#Automated_Surface_Observing_System_.28ASOS.29\" target=\"_blank\">Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS)</a> in 1991 dramatically increased the number of measuremnets taken, which accounts for much of the temperature averages dropping in later years (more automated readings taken during winter seasons where temperatures are low)\n",
