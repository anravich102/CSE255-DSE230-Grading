    "# Weather Analysis of Eldorado National Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report we'll analyze historic weather data of the area which is roughly Eldorado National Forest and Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. The data we will use here comes from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). Specifically, it was downloaded from this [FTP site](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/).\n",
    "\n",
    "As is shown in below map, each circle indicates a weather station and area of the circle is propotional to number of observations in that station.\n",

    "<p><img alt=\"map_stat.png\" src=\"mFigures/map_stat.png\" style=\"height:300px\" /></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The data has six measurements:\n",
    "* **TMIN, TMAX:** the daily minimum and maximum temperature.\n",
    "* **TOBS:** The average temperature for each day.\n",
    "* **PRCP:** Daily Percipitation (in mm)\n",
    "* **SNOW:** Daily snowfall (in mm)\n",
    "* **SNWD:** The depth of accumulated snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a basic idea of the data, let's first look at the __mean__ and __standard deviation__ of six measurements.\n",
    "<p><img alt=\"mean1.png\" src=\"mFigures/mean1.png\" style=\"height:300px\" /></p>\n",
    "<p><img alt=\"mean2.png\" src=\"mFigures/mean2.png\" style=\"height:300px\" /></p>\n",

    "We can see seasonal changing temperature and percipitation.It's hot and dry in summer, and cold and wet and snowish in winter.\n",

    "### sanity check:\n",
    "To avoid data corruption, let's first check the data from other sources, such as <a href=\"http://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/placerville/california/united-states/usca0876\" target=\"_blank\">US Climate Data</a>. The graph below shows the daily minimum and maximum temperatures for each month, as well as the total precipitation for each month.\n",
    "<p><img alt=\"check\" src=\"mFigures/check.png\" style=\"height:300px\" /></p>\n",
    "After translate Fahrenheit to Celsius and inch to millimeter, data from this chart agrees with our data. The highest temperature in summer is about 90&deg;F, which is about 32&deg;C. And percipitation in January is 7 inches, which is about 178 mm, summing up the percipitation of days in our data lead to similar number."

    "Top 5 eigen-vectors capture 14% and 17.5% of variance of __daily snowfall__ and __percipitation__, which may be due to their drastic variation between days. On the other hand, top 5 eigen-vectors explain 85% of variance of __snow depth__, with the fisrt one accounting for 70%.\n",

    "![sn1](mFigures/sn1.png)\n",
    "The first eigen-function (eig1) has a very similar shape to the mean. They arrive at peek at similar time, and both reduce to zero in summer. The interpretation of this shape is that eig1 represents the overall amount of snow above/below the mean, but without changing the distribution over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**eig2,eig3** both oscilate between positive and negative values. In other words, they correspond to changing the distribution of the snow depth over the winter months, but they don't change the total (much).\n",
    "\n",
    "They can be interpreted as follows:\n",
    "* **eig2:** more snow in Jan - Feb, less snow in feb - Apr.\n",

    "Coeff2: most negative\n",
    "![c2+](mFigures/c2-.png)\n",
    "Large positive values of coeff2 correspond to an early snow season - most of the snowfall is between Jan and Feb. Negative values for coeff2 correspond to a late snow season - most of the snow is in Apr. The residual indicates how well the reconstruction is. The smaller res is, the more line __c1__ resembles target."
