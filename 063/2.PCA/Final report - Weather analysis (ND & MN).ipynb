To compare the precipitation, we convert millimeter/day to inches/month. From the data, we see that the average rainfall peaks to around 3 mm / day during June / July which translates to about 3.55 inches / per month. According to US-Climate-Data the average rainfall during June is closer to 3.8 inches per month. Also, we see that the trend remains the same -- low rainfall during early months and then peaks during mid-year and then low again towards end of the year.</p>\n",
