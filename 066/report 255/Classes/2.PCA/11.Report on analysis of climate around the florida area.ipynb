    "This is a report on the historical analysis of weather patterns in an area that approximately overlaps the area of north part of the state of Florida and south part of the state of Georgia. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will use here comes from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). Specifically, it was downloaded from This [FTP site](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We focused on six measurements:\n",
    "* **TMIN, TMAX:** the daily minimum and maximum temperature.\n",
    "* **TOBS:** The average temperature for each day.\n",
    "* **PRCP:** Daily Percipitation (in mm)\n",

Notice that Centigrade that we got from the data should divide by 10 because when we try to draw the plot, we have multiplied the Centigrad by 10 to get more accurate numbers. Also, 0 means mean+std, 1 means mean and 2 means mean-std in our plot</p>\n",

    "<p>To compare the precipitation&nbsp;we need to translate millimeter/day to inches/month. According to our analysis the average rainfall is 3.50 mm/day which translates to about 4.27 Inches&nbsp;per month. Notice that in the plot below, the unit is tenths of millimeter. According to US-Climate-Data the average rainfall is closer to 4.29 inch per month.

On the other hand the top 5 eigenvectors explain 90% of the variance for SNOW and 92% of the variance for SNWD. This means that these top 5 eigenvectors capture most of the variation in the snow signals. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as we've mentioned in the first part, north florida and south georgia snows so little that we even cannot find the data on the US Climate website. So maybe the high percentage is because this area snows so little, so the eigenvectors explain the variance for the opposite--not snowing. In this way, it makes no sense to analyze the snow or snow depth further.\n",

    "Next we interpret the eigen-functions. The first eigen-function (eig1) doesn't change so much for the whole year, but we could still find there is a little concave in the middle. So it has an opposite shape to the mean function. The interpretation of this shape is that eig1 represents the overall amount of temperature above/below the mean, but in an opposite way. Maybe that's because most of the time, the temperature in this area is quite high, so the low temperature will conspicuous when it occurs.\n",

That is the temperature in North Florida and South Georgia is ofter high, so when the low temperature occurs, it will be quite obvious.\n",
