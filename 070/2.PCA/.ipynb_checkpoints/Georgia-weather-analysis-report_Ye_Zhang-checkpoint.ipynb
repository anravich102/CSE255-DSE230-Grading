On the other hand the top 5 eigenvectors explain %85 of the variance for SNWD. This means that these top 5 eigenvectors capture most of the variation in the snow signals. Based on that we will dig deeper into the PCA analysis for snow-depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes sense that snow signals, both SNOW and SNWD, are less noisy than rain fall signal PRCP. It is because the temperature in Georgia is high. It rains much easier than snow. In orther words, the snow signal varies less between he same date on different yesars. Comparing SNOW and SNWD, it makes sense that SNWD would be less noisy than SNOW. That is because SNWD is a decaying integral of SNOW and, as such, varies less between days and between the same date on diffferent years."
