    "We could draw the following conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compared with TMAX and TMIN, TOBS has is better explained by the top 5 eigenvectors. An explaination for this is that TOBS is a daily average temperature, which is more stable than TMIN and TMAX.\n",
    "2. SNOW and PRCP is extremely bad fitted. This is because raining and snowing are affected by a lot of factors, and this two measurements don't have accumulation over time, thus are more hard to fit merely based on historical data. The result would be much better if we do a convolution over time.\n",
    "3. It makes sense that SNWD would be less noisy than SNOW. That is because SNWD is a decaying integral of SNOW and, as such, varies less between days and between the same date on diffferent years."
