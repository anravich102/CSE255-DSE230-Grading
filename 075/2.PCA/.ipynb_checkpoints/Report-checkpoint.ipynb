    "\n",
    "San Jose/Bay Area is typical subtropical Mediterranean climate which snow is rarely seen. (As shown in previous section, mean for SNOW and SNWD were both approximately zero millimeter throughout years.) Due to the limitation of the nature of data, it’s not a surprise to see a low percentage of variance being explained. On the other hand, even though with limited snow amount, as SNWD (Snow depth) has less variation among dates and same date in different years, SNWD compared with SNOW has higher percentage of variance explained by eigen-vectors than SNOW. Meanwhile, since precipitation is a complicated weather phenomenon and is controlled by various factors, it’s not surprising to see that there’s no dominant factor found using PCA analysis on PRCP.\n",

    "### Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "In general the climate in San Jose/Bay Area is Mediterranean climate with rare snows and mild temperatures. The PCA analysis and Regression analysis were performed to examine the weather data in general in order to find effects and patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are six variables included in this analysis as target-- three temperature variables (TMIN, TMAX, TOBS) and three weather variables (PRCP, SNOW, SNWD).\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA analysis is very helpful in analyzing temperature related factors such as TMIN, TMAX and TOBS. Especially for TOBS, we were able to get more than 60% of variance explained by the top 5 eigen-vectors, within which the top eigen-vector alone explained 50% of the variance. However, PCA analysis didn't show much strength in explaining weather related variables such as PRCP, SNOW or SNWD.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we used Linear Regression analysis (OLS method) on all six variables to find out what's the impact of elevation on each of them. We found that elevation has statistically significant (positive or negative) impact on five out of the six variables (TMIN is the only one not significant). However, even though the p-values and t-statistics strongly support statistical significance on the models, all three of the temperature models do not have a good representation of the entire data with low R-squared values. On the other hand, three weather variables all show strong statistical significance that support the effect of elevation on each of them; especially for SNOW, the R-Square was also able to explain at least one third of the entire data.\n",
