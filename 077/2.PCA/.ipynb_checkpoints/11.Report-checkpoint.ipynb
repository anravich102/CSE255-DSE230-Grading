    "## The variation in the observed temperature is mostly due to station-to-station variation\n",
    "In the previous section we see the variation of Coeff1, which corresponds to: \n",
    "(a) more than average observed temperature for positive values, with respect to location. \n",
    "(b) less than average observed temperature for negative values, with respect to location. \n",
    "We now estimate the relative importance of location-to-location variation relative to year-by-year variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are measured using the fraction by which the variance is reduced when we subtract from each station/year entry the average-per-year or the average-per-station respectively. Here are the results:\n",

This effect holds true while considering coeff1 (which has to do with the average observed temperature) and coeff_2.

    "## Analysis of correlation between observed temperature across locations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis:\n",
    "Since we are considering stations in a small area, we can make a hypothsis that these stations must be correlated as far as observed temperature is considered. This is because the regions which are close to each other generally have similar temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Null Hypothesis\n",
    "Null hypothesis is basically opposite to the hypothesis which we made above. According to it the observed temperature in the two locations is independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### P-value\n",
    "In order to find the correlation between two stations, we will consider the following question: Whether the observed temperature in both locations is similar or not? We then compute the probability (p-value) associated with the number of overlaps under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "The significance of the p-value is the probability of seeing the result given by the data under the null hypothesis. So a low p-value means that it is unlikely to see such results under the null hypothesis. The usual conclusion that we can make is that if data is extremely unlikely under the null hypothesis, then the null hypothesis is wrong for that dataset.\n",
    "The histogram of all P_norm values obtained between every pair of two stations is given in the figure below.\n",
    "![tobs_significance.png](Figures_new/tobs_significance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above figure we see that mostly the p-values are below 0.5 which suggests that the null hypothesis is wrong for the dataset. Hence, we can say that the two locations are dependent as far as observed temperature is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In matrix form, the p-values are shown below. The rows and columns correspond to the station numbers. The value at (i,j) index is the p-norm value for the stations i and j.\n",
    "![tobs_p.png](Figures_new/tobs_p.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we reorder the rows and columns of the matrix using one of the eigenvectors, then the grouping of the stations become more evident (see the figure below).\n",
    "![tobs_p1.png](Figures_new/tobs_p1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the figures shown above, we can say that the initial 5-10 stations are highly correlated with each other. If the color of the cell is bluish, then it means that the stations are more correlated with each other. On the other hand, if the cell is yellowish in color, then it indicates that the stations are somewhat less correlated. \n",
    "We observe that some of the nearby stations are less correlated with each other. A possible explanation for this is that Yosemite national park has many hills. So a station which is on top of a hill will have less observed temperature than the station which is at the bottom of the hill. Thus, despite being close to each other, both of them will vary as far as observed temperature is considered. "
