    "Next we analyze how the top 3 coefficients vary with elevation. We have seen previously that the first eigenvector is largely a negative of the mean. This implies that coeff_1 should decrease and become negative where there is higher snow. The plot of coeff_1 given below then makes intuitive sense because higher elevations are correlated with higher rainfall. That must be why coeff_1 becomes highly negative for higher elevations. The reverse of the argument will hold for coeff 2 to a certain extent and thus we see a slight increase in its value with increasing elevation. \n",
