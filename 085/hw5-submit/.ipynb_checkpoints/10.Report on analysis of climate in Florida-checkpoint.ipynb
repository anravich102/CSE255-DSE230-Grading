    "The data we will use here comes from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). Specifically, it was downloaded from [FTP site](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/).\n",

    "\n",
    "We also notice only two eigenvectors is almost enough to capture 100% of the variance for SNWD, but SNOW needs 5 eigenvectors, which means that SNWD is a little less noisy than SNOW. This is because SNWD is a decaying integral of SNOW and, as such, varies less between days and between the same date on diffferent years. \n",
