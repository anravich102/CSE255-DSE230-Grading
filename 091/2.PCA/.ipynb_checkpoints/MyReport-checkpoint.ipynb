I print all the datapoints that have non-zero snow fall and find that some of the reason that the value is not zero may due to the elevation of that station. For example, there is a station with elevation -999.9 and total snow fall 3 in a year. However, most of the data makes no sense at all, like elevation 6.1 with snow fall 185. They should be seen as outliers from my point of view.  </p>"

Thus, we will dig deeper into the PCA analysis for minimum temperature in a day.\n"
