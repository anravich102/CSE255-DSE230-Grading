An alternative is to ignore the amount of rain, and just ask whether it rained in both locations.

To do this, we calculate the normalized log probability for each pair of stations. We then draw a correlation matrix, which maps p-values of the stations.

So a low p-value means that it is unlikely to see such results under the null hypothesis. We can see that many data points have significant p-values.
