    "This is a report on the historical analysis of weather patterns in an area that approximately overlaps the area of the middle-west state of Georgia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will use here comes from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). Specifically, it was downloaded from This [FTP site](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We focused on six measurements:\n",
    "* **TMIN, TMAX:** the daily minimum and maximum temperature.\n",
    "* **TOBS:** The average temperature for each day.\n",
    "* **PRCP:** Daily Percipitation (in mm)\n",
    "* **SNOW:** Daily snowfall (in mm)\n",
    "* **SNWD:** The depth of accumulated snow.\n",

According to our analysis the average rainfall is 3.50 mm/day which translates to about 4.14 Inches&nbsp;per month. According to US-Climate-Data the average rainfall is closer to 3.8 inch per month. However, there is clear agreement that the shape of fluctuation is almost the same with US-Climate-Data.</p>\n",

    "For each of the six measurement, we compute the percentate of the variance explained as a function of the number of eigen-vectors used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Percentage of variance explained.\n",
    "![VarExplained1.png](my_figures/VarExplained1.png)\n",
    "We see that the top 5 eigen-vectors explain 22% of variance for TMIN, 48% for TOBS and 21% for TMAX.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude that of the three, TOBS is best explained by the top 5 eigenvectors. This is especially true for the first eigen-vector which, by itself, explains 39% of the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![VarExplained2.png](my_figures/VarExplained2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 5 eigenvectors explain 7% of the variance for PRCP, which is a low value. On the other hand the top 5 eigenvectors explain 53% for SNOW(much higher than that of Boston) and %85 of the variance for SNWD. This means that these top 5 eigenvectors capture most of the variation in the snow signals. Based on that we will dig deeper into the PCA analysis for snow-depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes sense that SNWD would be less noisy than SNOW. That is because SNWD is a decaying integral of SNOW and, as such, varies less between days and between the same date on diffferent years."
