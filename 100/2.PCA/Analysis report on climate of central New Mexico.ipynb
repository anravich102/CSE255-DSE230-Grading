    "# Weather Analysis of New Mexico's Central Region\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an analysis report on the climate pattern in an area which basically overlaps the central region of New Mexico. The dataset we use is from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/) and contains climate data from 1854 to 2012 collected by 206 stations in that area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Six measurements are considered in this report:\n",
    "* **TMIN, TMAX:** Daily minimum and maximum temperature (in &deg;C)\n",
    "* **TOBS:** Average temperature for each day (in &deg;C)\n",
    "* **PRCP:** Daily Precipitation (in mm)\n",
    "* **SNOW:** Daily snowfall (in mm)\n",
    "* **SNWD:** The depth of accumulated snow (in mm)\n",

    "## Sanity Check\n",
    "\n",
    "We first compare our data with some outside sources as a sanity check, for which we use a graph obtained from <a href=\"http://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/albuquerque/new-mexico/united-states/usnm0370\" target=\"_blank\">US Climate Data</a>. The graph below shows the min and max daily temperture as well as the monthly precipitations in Albuquerque, which is the largest city in central New Mexico.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"Albuquerque_Climate_Graph.png\" src=\"report_figures/Albuquerque_Climate_Graph.png\" style=\"width:50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the min and max daily temperature in Albuquerque respectively range from about 25&deg;F to 65&deg;F (-3.9&deg;C-18.3&deg;C) and from about 45&deg;F to 90&deg;F (7.2&deg;C-32.2&deg;C), which are not exactly the same as the means of TMIN and TMAX in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"T_MIN,T_MAX.png\" src=\"report_figures/T_MIN,T_MAX.png\" style=\"width:80%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, our data does agree with <a href=\"http://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/albuquerque/new-mexico/united-states/usnm0370\" target=\"_blank\">US Climate Data</a> in the sense that the max daily temperature occurs in July and August, and the minimum occurs in December and January. There is also a clear agreement that the difference between max and min temperatures stays roughly constant throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The monthly precipitation in Albuquerque is close to a constant (about 0.5 inch/month or 0.42 mm/day) in most of the months other than from July to October, when the maximum in a year (about 1.5 inch/month or 1.27 mm/day) is reached. This generally agrees with our data except that the maximum value in our data is somewhat greater (around 2.5 mm/day).\n",

    "To begin with, we compute the percentage of the variance explained as a function of the number of eigenvectors used.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is shown that the variance explained by the top 5 eigenvectors is 39% for TMIN, 58% for TOBS, 43% for TMAX, 10% for SNOW, 85% for SNWD and 7% for PRCP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, SNWD is explained the best by the top 5 eigenvectors, especially provided that the first eigenvector itself explains 65% of the variance. What follows is TOBS, whose first eigenvector explains more than 50% of the variance. The rest of the measurements are, however, much more noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes much sense for that TOBS, as the average temperature, should be more stable than TMIN and TMAX; and that SNWD, as an accumulation of SNOW, should vary less between the same date in different years.\n",
    "\n",
    "We, therefore, focus on SNOW and TOBS in the following sections."

    "### Top 3 Eigenvectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below illustrates the mean and top 3 eigenvectors of SNWD. From the mean, we see that the snow season in this area is from mid-October to mid-May. The peak of snow depth occurs in January, which happens to be the coldest monthly in that area.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first eigenvector is just like a negative version of the mean: it is negative during the snow season and closes to zero in rest of the months. But the bottom is touched in March rather than January. We conclude that **eig1** represents the overall amount of snow less/more than the average without changing the general distribution much.\n",
    "\n",
    "**eig2** and **eig3** both wiggle between positive and negative values, which leads to a change in the distribution of snow over time. We interpret **eig2** as less snow in January and February and more snow in March and April, which actually delays the peak of snow depth in a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**eig3** acts somewhat similarly to **eig2**: it too implies more snow in March and April and less snow in January and February. What distinguishes it is that it significantly increases the snow depth in December. Distributions with a greater coefficient of **eig3** are likely to have a sub peak in December.\n",
