    "Beyond the measurement SNWD, the measurements TBOS, TMIN and TMAX have the similar variance - their percentage of variance explained are 70%, 63% and 58%, and the corresponding first eigen-vector variance explained are 60%, 55% and 48%. For these three temperature measurements, the top 5 eigen-vectors explain over half variance.\n",
