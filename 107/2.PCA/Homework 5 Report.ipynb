    "<p>The differences are mostly due to the Climate weather data is mostly centered at Florida, whereas my data is centered at the intersection between three states. From the graph, there's a clear similar rainfall pattern in that region. Most of the rainfall season happens from June to August in the summer. There's a significant amount of decreas in rainfall for April and May, which is reflected from both the US Climate Data and my graph.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "In this region, there are a huge amount of rainfall throughout the year which results in a lot of variance for precipitation. Therefore, using eigenvectos to capture the variance of rainfall is a very hard. Top 5 eigenvectos can only explain 6.5% of the variance due to the large amount of rainfall across the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the other hand, it is expected that the amount of snow is very small in this region, which means the variance between snowfall is small and it only takes a few eigenvectors to explain most of the variance. In this case, the top 5 eigenvectors explain 90% of variance for both SNOW and SNWD. However, we normally expect that SNWD to be less noisy than SNOW since SNWD is a decaying integral of SNOW and varies less between days and between the same date on different years unless the amount of SNOW and SNWD is very small, which likely to result in only 1 or 2 snowfalls throughout the whole year and therefore results in this case."

I decide to not analyize precipitation or snowfall because precipitation in this region is very hard to capture by eigen-decomposition as we have seen in the earlier graph, top 5 eigenvector only explains 6.5% of the variance. It's also not interesting to analyize snowfall because there's rarely any snowfall in this region. \n",

This is also reflected in the eigen-function graph, where there's less variance in the middle and much more variance in the ends for all 5 eigen-functions. The temperature peaks at the middle of May and stay there until middle of August. \n",

    "Next we interpret the eigen-functions. The first eigen-function (eig1) has a shape very similar to the mean function, which is a straight line that indicates the overall average temperature throughout the year. Similarly, this function mostly capture the overall average temperature throughout the year and does not oscillate at the ends. The interpretation of this shape is that eig1 represents the overall temperature for this region and act as a baseline for the rest of the eigen-functions to capture the overall variance of TOBS.\n",

    "**eig2,eig3,eig4 and eig5** are similar in the following way. They all oscilate between positive and negative values. The oscilation occurs in a larger range in the colder months and less in the warmer months. In other words, they correspond to changing the distribution of the average temperature, where there are more variances in the ends and less in the middle. Also, from the variance graph, we know that th first eigen-vectors captures 40% of the variances and the subsequent eigen-vectors capture roughly 2% each time. Therefore, eigen-vectors 2 to 5 actually does not contain a lot of meanful information.\n",
