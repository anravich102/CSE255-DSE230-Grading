    "Wyoming is a dry state with much of the land receiving less than 10 inches (250 mm) of rainfall per year. Summers in Wyoming are warm with July high temperatures averaging between 85 and 95 째F (29 and 35 째C) in most of the state. With increasing elevation, however, this average drops rapidly with locations above 9,000 feet (2,700 m) averaging around 70 째F (21 째C). Winters are cold, but are variable with periods of sometimes extreme cold interspersed between generally mild periods.\n",

In the months in between, i.e. April end-mid October, there is no snow. Thus, we can see that the peaks are much higher than the mean curve. Also, there are more peaks, compared to the mean curve which is relatively smooth.\n",

This is more prominent in the months between January and April. Thus, the absolute depth of snow is less than the mean during these months for the most negative values of coeff1. In the period between October and December, however, the curve almost aligns perfectly with the mean curve.\n",

    "Coeff2: most negative\n",
    "![SNWD_grid_neg_coeff2.png](Figures/SNWD_grid_neg_coeff2.png)\n",

Indeed, when we observe the map, we see that the stations near Jackson are all pretty close to each other, and hence, there is a higher chance of the stations being highly correlated in terms of snow depth, as places at shorter distances would intuitively tend to have similar weather conditions.\n",
