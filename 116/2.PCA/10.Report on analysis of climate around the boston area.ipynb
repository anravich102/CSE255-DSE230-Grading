The interpretation of this shape is that eig1 represents the overall amount of snow above/below the mean, but without changing the distribution over time.\n",

    "The rest three vectors are not easy to interpret. The eig2 shows that there should be lower temprature at July and the eig3 shows the cooling down from July to December. The eig4 has a very unstable shape and it bascially point about some small sharp wave on the pictures. \n",
    "**eig2,eig3 and eig4** As far as I can see, these three vectors are all representing the unstable part of the temprature. As we can see in the graph. The basic trend of the average temprature is very stable, I mean, it is hotter in summer and colder in winter. However, the all vector here are trying to show that there are some unstable elements in the graph. The vector eig1 shows the biggest cooling down process and the rest three vectors have give use the distribution of small shock time across the all year. The three vectors(eig2,eig3,eig4) all show that the temperature from June to July is unreasonable high and it should be reduced.\n"

    "## The variation in the timing of TOBS is mostly due to station location\n",
    "In this part we are going to decide the most effective part of the variation. As we can see below, the coeff_1 part shows that the station can explain 34 percent of the data variation while the year to year can only explain 3.8 percent. This means that the station location has large effect on the variation of TOBS. Another thing is that the weather of Arizona is very stable from year to year. The year to year data can only explain 3.8 percent of the variatant.\n",
    "The coeff2,3,4 show something different. The year to year data start to take some role in variation and the year to year data can explain 14,27,23 percent of the variation. Although they are no more that the station data in coeff_1, but they are still more that coordinate station data. These data means that year-to-year data diffs on dates, but the frequency is the same. It means that the weather of Arizona has a periodic pattern,which is not the exactly 365 days(maybe 360 days). For every year, the weather pattern is very stable and has little difference. But the detail are different. The coeff2,3,4 shows that those details diffs. My guess is that there may be some silghtly dislocation from year to year. For example, in 1967 March 13 is very hot and in 1968 the March 15 is very hot. For the global version, there is a very hot day in March, but the detail is there are two days interval. So only when we go to the detail, the year to year begins to take its role.\n",
