    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a report on the historical analysis of weather patterns in an area that approximately overlaps the area of the state of Idaho. The report illustrates the analysis and reconstruction of the parameters like depth of accumulated snow and precipitation patterns using statistical analysis and PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the analysis we focused on six measurements:\n",
    "* **TMIN, TMAX:** the daily minimum and maximum temperature.\n",
    "* **TOBS:** The average temperature for each day.\n",
    "* **PRCP:** Daily Percipitation (in mm)\n",
    "* **SNOW:** Daily snowfall (in mm)\n",
    "* **SNWD:** The depth of accumulated snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will use here comes from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). Specifically, it was downloaded from This [FTP site](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Sanity-check: comparison with outside sources\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We start by comparing some of the general statistics with graphs that we obtained from a site called <a href=\"http://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/boston/massachusetts/united-states/usma0046\" target=\"_blank\">US Climate Data</a>. The graph below shows the daily minimum and maximum temperatures for each month, as well as the total precipitation for each month.</p>\n",

    "<p>To compare the precipitation&nbsp;we need to translate millimeter/day to inches/month. According to our analysis the average rainfall is 8.72 mm/day which translates to about 10.29 Inches&nbsp;per month. According to US-Climate-Data the average rainfall is closer to 9.78 inch per month. However, there is clear agreement that average precipitation&nbsp;is close to a constant throughout the year</p>\n",

    "## 3. Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We start the analysis of our data by identifying the different stations from where we would be collecting data from. From the below geo chart, we observe that there are close to 40 stations and they are distributed all over the state of Idaho.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>&nbsp;<img alt=\"Geo distribution of stations\" src=\"r_figures/geo_distribution_analysis.png\" style=\"height:400px; width:600px\" /></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We also analyze how the precipitation and snow depth differ across the year for a particular station. For example, we consider the station USC00105980 and analyze how precipitation and snow depth differ across a particular year 1949. It is clear that snow and rain do not overlap with each other.\n",

    "<p>&nbsp;<img alt=\"PRCP vs SNWD\" src=\"r_figures/prcp_vs_snwd.png\" style=\"height:400px; width:600px\" /></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We check if there is any sparse (or missing) data and observe that the valid points count (measured as the data points without a NaN) is high during the months of April to October and have more missing/invalid points during January and December. We observe more or less similar behavior with all the parameters. \n",

    "\n",
    "As a part of any data analysis task, it is essential to observe the distribution of the data at hand esp. the mean, standard deviation, etc. We plot the mean-SD, mean and mean+SD of the snow depth data and find that there is appreciable deviation from the mean during January to April and October to December.\n",

    "### 3.A. Percentage of variance explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we will be constructing the data pattern from its eigen vectors with minimal reconstruction error. So, we compute the percentage of the variance explained as a function of the number of eigen vectors used. The more the variance explained by eigen vectors, the lower the reconstruction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "![VarExplained1.png](r_figures/Rupert_VarExplained1.png)\n",
    "We see that the top 5 eigen-vectors explain 31% of variance for TMIN, 55% for TOBS and 32% for TMAX.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude that of the three, both TOBS is best explained by the top 5 eigenvectors. This is especially true for the first eigen-vector which, by itself, explains 50% of the variance in TOBS.\n",
    "\n",
    "![VarExplained2.png](r_figures/Rupert_VarExplained2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 5 eigenvectors explain 10% of the variance for PRCP and 13% for SNOW. Both are low values. On the other hand the top 5 eigenvectors explain 91% of the variance for SNWD. This means that these top 5 eigenvectors capture most of the variation in the snow signals. Based on that we will dig deeper into the PCA analysis for snow-depth.\n",

The first eigen-function (eig1) has a shape very similar to the mean function but in the opposite direction. The interpretation of this shape is that eig1 represents the overall amount of snow above/below the mean, but without changing the distribution over time. Eig1 helps to reconstruct the overall distribution of the snow. As a sidenote, since eig1 is negative, we would expect its coefficient c1 also to be negative. This is proved as we observe the most of the weather stations's coefficient 1 (coeff_1) is negative.\n",
