    "\n",
    "The top 5 eigenvectors explain 7% of the variance for PRCP and 14% for SNOW. Both are low values. On the other hand the top 5 eigenvectors explain %75 of the variance for SNWD. This means that these top 5 eigenvectors capture most of the variation in the snow signals. Based on that we will dig deeper into the PCA analysis for snow-depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes sense that SNWD would be less noisy than SNOW. That is because SNWD is a decaying integral of SNOW and, as such, varies less between days and between the same date on diffferent years."
