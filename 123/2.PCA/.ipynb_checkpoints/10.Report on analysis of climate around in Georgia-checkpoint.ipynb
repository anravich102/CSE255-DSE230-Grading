    "\n",
    "From our previous knowledge and reading about the the climate of Georgia from the internet, we find that the climate of Georgia is typical of a humid subtropical climate with most of the state having mild winters and hot summers. The Atlantic Ocean on the east coast of Georgia and the hill country in the north impact the state's climate. Even though our region of study does not have beaches or coastal areas as such, these factors do influence the weather. Winter in Georgia is characterized by mild temperatures and very little snowfall around the state, with colder, snowier, and icier weather more likely across northern and central Georgia. Summer daytime temperatures in Georgia often exceed 32 Â°C. The state experiences widespread precipitation and this is clearly evident from the data that we will be seeing and discussng. Tornadoes and tropical cyclones are common.\n",

However, note that it is more likely to snow in places with elevation less than 100 feet. Also, note that there isn't much snow even at the higher elevations. This can be attributed to the geographical nature of Georgia.\n",
    "\n",
    "For elevation v/s temperature plots, we see that TMIN is lower at higher elevations which makes sense. \n",

    "### Year-wise Analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "We get some interesting insights from the data here, especially from the TOBS v/s year plot. We see that the observed temperature has risen over the years and is constantly rising. While one might feel that this is an indication of **global warming**, we shouldn't rely on this as the TOBS (observed temperature) is the temperature at the time the temperature was observed. Someone may decide to measure the temperature at 2 AM while others at 2 PM. So even though the graph might not have a lot of significance, it is interesting to see that TOBS does increase over the years. Also, note that for the TOBS graph, we took the maximum value in a year that was observed. When we plot the average, it actually goes down (probably owing to the huge amounts of zeros, as observed in the scatter plot given below).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also see that the rare snow and snow depth values have decreased over the years in general. It was only around 1970s that Georgia received a lot of snow according to this data. We decided to reaffirm our analysis by looking up sources online and this [interesting article](http://www.macon.com/news/local/article30117315.html) tells about the great snow of 1973 which might have caused the spike in our dataset. Note that it occasionally hails/snows in Georgia, one instance being [the White Christmas of 2010](https://www.weather.gov/ffc/snow20101225).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the plots below show us that most of our data is from recent years and there is a huge fraction of data for TOBS that is zero, which definitely doesn't seem correct.\n",

Principal components analysis is a procedure for identifying a smaller number of uncorrelated variables, called \"principal components\", from a large set of data. The goal of principal components analysis is to explain the maximum amount of variance with the fewest number of principal components. Principal components analysis is commonly used in the social sciences, market research, and other industries that use large data sets.\n",

    "\n",
    "The top 5 eigenvectors explain 6.2% of the variance for PRCP. The corresponding values for SNOW and SNWD are 62% and 92% respectively. The value for precipitation is very low but ones for SNOW and SNWD are fairly high. This means that these top 5 eigenvectors capture most of the variation in the snow signals. Based on that we will dig deeper into the PCA analysis for snow-depth. Note that this analysis also re-affirms our prior beliefs which included the fact that it rarely snows in Georgia while it rains a lot. The rains are unpredictable and noisy up to a great extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that it makes sense that SNWD would be less noisy than SNOW. That is because SNWD is a decaying integral of SNOW and as such, varies less between days and between the same date on diffferent years."

    "\n",
    "**eig2,eig3 and eig4** are similar to eig1 in the way that they all represent some peaks in the data. In other words, they correspond to changing the distribution of the snow depth over the winter months, but they don't change the total much.

    "As discussed and seen in earlier plots, it snows very less in Georgia. We decided to inspect the data closely for these plots to come up with the anomalies. Also note that there are small spikes around the May-June time-frame in the plot depicting means. We found that there were about 141 total distinct entries with snow (station and year combination) out of the 2k plus entries, and just 39 distinct cities which ever received snowfall during the entire data set. The average elevation of these cities was just 82. There were 32 instances in the first half of the year where it snowed, 16 at end and twice in between - which might be responsible for the small peaks that we see during May-June time-frame.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The weather data for Georgia region had little to offer in terms of consistency of snow or precipitation, but the above analysis gives us great insights into the data. We see that most of the high precipitation places belong together and the snow distribution is rather sparse, with only 2.3% instances of the total had non-zero snow values. We see the trends in temperatures, snow and precipitation and validate our claims using external data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For future analysis, we would like to investigate similar kind of trends for TMIN and TMAX variables and investigate the existence of global warming using this data. Also, studying a more correlated feature like 'humidity' in conjunction with precipitation and snow would be a good direction to go. In a nutshell, the analysis seemed elaborate and correct as it is backed by external sources and data. However, given the nature of the weather of the state of Georgia, we were unable to reconstruct our targets well using the eigen-functions extracted from the data."
