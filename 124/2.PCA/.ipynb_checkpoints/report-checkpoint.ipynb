    "The results is really impressive due to consistency with the observation in the previous part. First, we can see that locations can explain 70% variance of coeff_1. It makes sense because the first vector represents that there are less snow in the whole snow season. It is a general phenomenon so it won't vibrate heavily with timing. Secondly, we find that different years can explain 69% variance of coeff_2, and it confirms that the huge difference of coeff_2 in 1971 and 1972. Unlike coeff_1, coeff_2 represents abnormal cases which means the snow season is much different from the average. It is reasonable that this unusal phenomenon is dependent on years. Similarly, coeff_3 has also to do with the timing.\n",

    "## Spatial variation on Map\n",
    "Because the most positive coeff_1 means the overall decreasing snowfall and most negative coeff_1 represents the overall increasing snowfall, I wonder to think may be it is the elevation that dominates. We can the map below, and there are four blue cycles in the right part of graph. Blue cycles mean that they are more negative coeff_1 than red ones, and also mean that there are more snow in those areas.\n",

    "\n",
    "When I take a deeper look into those area, I find their elevations are higher. Look at the graph below, and we can see that there are several points which mean significantly negatvie coeff_1 in higher stations. It really makes sense that it is more likely to snow in higher places like mountaions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Besides coeff_1, we can also see other coefficients on map below. Differenct colors mean different coefficients and solid triangles mean positive values and hollow ones mean negative values. For example, the blue hollow trigangles correspond to negative coeff_1. However, this graph doesn't give too much insights because we can directly see the significance of each coefficient.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "It is very interesting to analyze data into useful information. For example, I find that there are deeper snow in several stations and then I conclude that the elevation is the key! More interestingly, I observe an abnormal phenomenon during 1971~1972 because thera are extra snow in the end of 1971 and the start of 1972. Then, I google [the world's deepest snow](https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/worlds-deepest-snow-photos), and find there is Washington Cascades in 1971~1972. It makes me so exciting to use the knowledge and tools taught in class to address real world problem!\n"
