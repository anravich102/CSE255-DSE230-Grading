    "- (ii.) Perhaps there is some really strong (almost uniform) colinearity between variables, and inexactness of floating point numerical computations there is a propagation of linearity and thus several of the eigenvalues become negative. This might be less likely the case because the negative eigenvalues are very large e.g. -6.5293e+02, whereas a very tiny negative eigenvalue might be contributed to floating point error. \n",

I wanted to show a general temperature trend over the data for my specific geographical region. All of my station's elevations are within a small range so they should not factor in too much. One issue with these measurements that I would like to explore more into is what time of day these readings are taken. Because the temperature for TOBS may change if it was taken during the morning, noon, or evening. Especially if these stations are not taking it during the same time within the same year across all stations, or at the same time of day across all of a station's years of data collection.\n",

    "One quick note, TOBS had some missing years and thus only has 7 epochs made, vs TMIN/TMAX. There is also a drastic decrease in the TOBS temp measurement in the late 1900s. The cause for this is probably due to the time TOBS (which is temperature during time of observation) was recorded. Along the lines of what I said in the previous paragraph. I believe that  we should also see a similar downward curve in the TMIN/TMAX plots if the temperature was on average decreasing such a drastic amount in the past 50 years. "

This is true for all three temperature measurements. Overall TOBS has a higher variance and this could be accounted for if TOBS is taken at different times during the day between stations. Or perhaps rain during the stormy months and winter  is far more dependent on the severity of storms, though in summer it rains only a little bit here and there. But a large storm could dump a tremendous amount of rain one week and then none the following week.\n",

Additionally, the snow measurements are really useless and should be removed. \n",
