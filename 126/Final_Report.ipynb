    "# Southeast Georgia and North Florida Weather Analysis\n",

    "This is a report on the historical analysis of weather patterns in an area that overlaps the area of the state of Georgia and partially the state of Florida, with latitudes and longitudes spanning from 33.326 to 30.185 and -83.468 to -82.037. The entire state, including the North Georgia mountains, receives moderate to heavy rain, which varies from 45 inches (1,100 mm) in central Georgia. Most of Georgia has a sub -tropical climate tempered some by occasional climax air masses in the winter, hot/humid summers are typical, except at the highest elevations. \n",
