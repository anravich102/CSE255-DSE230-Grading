    "In this report, we show the analysis of snow depth in the states of New Hampshire and Maine using PCA. We use the top 3 eigenvectors of the covariance matrix and find the meaning of each eigenvector. We also study the three coefficients and corresponding residuals. We find year can explain most variance of coefficient 2 and 3 which matches the map of distribution of the two coefficients. Finally, we study the correlation of rainfall across stations by utilizing SVD and plot the correlation matrix of top 4 eigenvectors. "
