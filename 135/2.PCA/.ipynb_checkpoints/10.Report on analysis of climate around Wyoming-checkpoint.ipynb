    "We focused on six measurements:\n",
    "* **TMIN, TMAX:** the daily minimum and maximum temperature.\n",

    "The top 5 eigenvectors explain 11% of the variance for PRCP and 9% for SNOW. Both are low values. On the other hand the top 5 eigenvectors explain 85% of the variance for SNWD. This means that these top 5 eigenvectors capture most of the variation in the snow depth signals. Based on that we will dig deeper into the PCA analysis for snow-depth.\n",

This effect has to do with the total snowfall (coeff_1), vs. coeff_2,3 which, as we saw above have to do with the timining of snowfall. We see that for coeff_2,3 the stations explain 12-24% of the variance while the year explaines ~40%. Hence location better explains the amount of snowfall and time (years) better explains the snow-season (timing) of snowfall."
