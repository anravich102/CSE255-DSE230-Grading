For Coeff3, the order is flipped. As discussed above that the third eigen-vector (eig3) tells information about temperature changes due to rainfall, it makes sense that the Coeff3 exlpains more year based data than station based because rain is highly likely to vary over years, but for nearby locations it rain will be similar. For Coeff2 and Coeff4, the fraction explained is almost same.
