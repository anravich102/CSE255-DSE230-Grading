    "We conclude that of the three, TOBS is best explained by the top 5 eigenvectors. This is especially true for the first eigen-vector which, by itself, explains 50% of the variance. But the first eigen-vector of TMIN and TMAX also performs good, which explains 35% and 39% respectively. It is safe to infer that the pattern of temperatrue is pretty clear and forms some rules so that the eigen-vectors are able to catch the main pattern hidden in the observed data.\n",

    "### 3.1. Eigen-Vector Interpretation\n",
    "I choose to analyze the eigen-decomposition for snow-depth because the first 3 eigen-vectors explain 69% of the variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we graph the mean and the top 3 eigen-vectors. We observe that the snow season is from mid-November to the end of April, where the middle of February marks the peak of the snow-depth.\n",

    "Then we interpret the eigen-functions. The first eigen-function **eig1** has a shape very similar to the mean function. The main difference is that the eigen-function is a little bit close to zero during october-december while the mean is not.  The interpretation of this shape is that eig1 represents the overall amount of snow above/below the mean, but without changing the distribution over time. **eig2 and eig3** are similar in the following way. They all oscilate between positive and negative values. In other words, they correspond to changing the distribution of the snow depth over the winter months, but they don't change the total (much).\n",
    "\n",
    "They can be interpreted as follows:\n",
    "* **eig1:** overall amount of snow above/below the mean.\n",
    "* **eig2:** start from Jan. to Apr., the snow depth keeps decreasing until mid March.\n",
    "* **eig3:** more snow in late Dec., less snow in Feb., slightly more snow in March.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2. Reconstruction-based Analysis\n",
    "In order to take a closer look about the eigen-vector so as to analyze the weather, I choose top-3 eigen-vectors to reconstuct the data records and compute its reconstruction residuals. For each data record, we can use  `decompose(row)` to extracts the series from the row, computes the residuals and constructs a new row that is reassembled into a dataframe. Note Coeff[i] here means the i^th coefficient of the corresponding (i-1)^th eigen-vector.\n",

    "Coeff1: most negative\n",
    "![SNWD_grid_neg_coeff1.png](own_figures/recon_c1_neg.png)\n",
    "Since we already knew that **eig1** represents the overall amount of snow above/below the mean. Therefore, large positive values of coeff1 correspond to more than average snow and low values correspond to less than average snow.\n",

    "Coeff2: most negative\n",
    "![SNWD_grid_neg_coeff2.png](own_figures/recon_c2_neg.png)\n",
    "Based on the meaning of **eig2** shown before, large positive values of coeff2 correspond to an early snow season. Negative values for coeff2 correspond to a late snow season. We can see in the picture, most of the snowfall is before mid feb, especially the very fist one picture, it snows mainly on Janurary. That's excatly explain that **eig2** shows the snow will decrease start from Jan and the depth of snow keeps decreasing. while in the second line, most of the snow is after mid-feb: the negative coeff2 is against the rule **eig2** shows.\n",

    "\n",
    "As **eig3** shows before, large positive values of coeff3 correspond to a snow season with two spikes: one in the late December, the other at the start of March. Negative values of coeff3 correspond to a season with a single peak around the Janurary. We can see that the picture shown above exactly represents these two situation, especially the left two, which have most significant inclination(either postive or negative) to **eig3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the specific analysis of each coeffcient, we can also get a high level idea about these three eigen-vectors through the distribution of the corresponding coefficients as shown below.\n",

    "<p><img alt=\"TMINTMAX.png\" src=\"own_figures/recon_all_distribution.png\" style=\"height:300px\" /></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "From this picture, we can easily find out how the data support each feature that eigen-vector represents. For the eig1, most corresponding coefficients are above zero, which means the snow depth follows the pattern of eigen-vector. The only difference is the level they supports. Comparing to eig1 which get supports from most of the data, eig2 and eig3 are kind of \"controversial\", especially eig3. Intuitively, based on our common knowledge, I would support eig2 more, because it is more likely to snow at Dec and Jan, and less likely to snow afterwards. And we can find that in the middle picture, although there might be some snow season reverse, but most of the coeffcients are positive and tend to agree with the opnion of the second eigen vector. As for the eig3, it represents the spike of the snow season, which contains more randomness, that's why we can see that the cumulative distribution is like the sigmoid function which means the supporters and opponents are half-half.  \n",

    "### 3.3. Geographical Distribution Analysis\n",
    "We can analyze the coeffcient distribution over elevation:\n",
    "<p><img alt=\"TMINTMAX.png\" src=\"own_figures/SNWD_ditribution_elevation.png\" style=\"height:400px\" /></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of SNWD over elevation also contains some information: at the low altitudes, the coefficients are almost the same. But when the elevation comes to 2200 or more, the coeff1 tends to become larger, which means the depth of snow becomes larger along with the elevation. Meanwhile, we can also find some outliers in the second and third graph, I think the main reason is when the elevation comes to around 3000, the snow depth varies a lot, because there may be some places hidden from sunshine so that the snow are not going to melt as fast as others. Which against the eig2. Of course, the usual area will speed up the melting process sine the temprature is going up, which will support the eig2. As for eig3, the randomness cames to become dominant, but the variation of coeff is also limits in 100. In conclusion, the eigen-vectors and the snow depth data interprets each other, and the depth is related to the elevation as we knew before. \n",

    "\n",
    "We see that the variation by year and by station performs different on different eigen-vectors: for coeff_1, station explains more while for coeff_3, temporal factor came to be dominant. I think the main reason is that the first eigen vector have to deal with all the locations' snow depth, which makes it more sensitive to the location. While for eigen vector 3, it may want to convey the information about the year factor. That's why its coefficient explains much more fration."

And the second picture tells us that top eigen-vectors are useless because they only explains small percentage of the variance.\n",
