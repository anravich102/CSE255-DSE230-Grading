    "### Initial Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We wanted to look for overall patterns of rainfall and snowfall in the area assigned.

This helped us in visualizing the pattern and the presence of rainfall and snowfall in the region.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "![PRCPForAllStationsForAllYears.png](final_report/PRCPForAllStationsForAllYears.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We were not very surprised to note that in some regions, snow was present till as late as the month of May and June and arrived as early as September. This observation is quite understandable, since most of the North Dakota and Minnesota region lies on the Northern side of North America, just below the Canadian border. Those locations are quite famous for their extreme weather conditions, which is evident from the graph below.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "![SNOWForAllStationsForAllYears.png](final_report/SNOWForAllStationsForAllYears.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>One surprising thing to note, though, was that it rained almost consistently throughout the year and not during specific periods. Each month had a minimum of 30 mm of rainfall, which shot up to as high as 80mm during the monsoon season.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This is probably the hardest part of data analysis. No data is perfect and neither was this one.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>To investigate more into the missing data, we plotted the frequency of valid counts for each measurement over the spread of an year. The graphs of the valid counts are shown below.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>The striking thing to note is that the graphs take the same shape for all the measurements. We have a low number of valid counts from the month of January to the month of March, followed by a good consistent number from the month of April to the month of October, finally culminating in a low number for the months of November and December.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Now, since these are pretty chilly and cold places, temperatures go down to -60 degree Fahrenheit (-51 degree Celsius). We are presently in the age of modern and digital equipments, which makes recording weather data look an easy task, but back in the day, it was a manual task, so it justifies the fact that we have low readings during the winter season, because these places observe harsh and chilly winters.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean and standard deviations\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Next we plot the mean and standard deviations of all the six measurements. The graphs for the temperature data are quite standard.

    "\n",
    "It is quite interesting to see that there is a dip in the variance explained when we add the second eigen vector of TMIN. This means that the value of the second eigen vector is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "This usually happens when our covariance matrix is not positive definite. There are a number of reasons because of which the covariance matrix is non positive definite. We list some of them below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Linear dependency</li>\n",
    "It may be possible that one feature of our input vector is completely linearly dependent on the some other feature. This results in linear dependency of one variable on the other and might result in a non positive definite matrix.\n",
    "<li>Missing data</li>\n",
    "A lot of missed readings can also result in a non positive definite matrix. It might be the case that we have a low number of readings for our input.\n",
    "<li>Corrupt data</li>\n",
    "This is one of the most likely reasons for a non positive definite matrix. We generally obtain negative eigen vectors when our data is corrupted by different sources. For ex, error during the data extraction and preprocessing stage.\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to circumvent this problem, we calculated the nearest positive definite covariance matrix using the technique provided on <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10939213/how-can-i-calculate-the-nearest-positive-semi-definite-matrix\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> website.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We conclude that of the three, TOBS is best explained by the top 5 eigenvectors. This is especially true for the first eigen-vector which, by itself, explains 20% of the variance. We also conclude that the data for TMIN might have been corrupted during the preprocessing stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "![VarianceSnow.png](final_report/VarianceSnow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 5 eigenvectors explain 8% of the variance for PRCP and 14% for SNOW. Both are low values. This is quite understandable if we relate this to one of the previous graph we plotted, where we showed that precipitation is one of the measurement with most variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand the top 5 eigenvectors explain %75 of the variance for SNWD. This means that these top 5 eigenvectors capture most of the variation in the snow signals. \n",
    "\n",
    "It makes sense that SNWD would be less noisy than SNOW. That is because SNWD is a decaying integral of SNOW and, as such, varies less between days and between the same date on diffferent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first dig deeper into the precipitation analysis and show that it is not really fruiful since lack of variance explained by the Eigen vectors. We will then go on to analyze snow depth since a lot of variance is being explained by Eigen vectors."

The variance explained graph was almost linear which basically means that we would need all of the 365 dimensions to represent our data. Also, precipitation wasn't constant throughout the entire year. There was heavy rainfall during the monsoons and light rainfall during the rest of the year.\n",
