    "In contrast, we picked up a measurement where the first few eigen vectors explained a moderate amount of variance. The same was observed in the reconstructions where high and low values captured anomalous target instances and  were different from the mean. The correlation between locations was much more sparse in this case but we observed definitive clusters in the case of yearly data."
