The main difference is that the eigen-function is close to zero during october-december while the mean is not.  The interpretation of this shape is that eig1 represents the overall amount of snow above/below the mean, but without changing the distribution over time. In order to confirm this we explore another statistical measure called coefficient of variation. The coefficient of variation is a measure of spread that describes the amount of variability relative to the mean. Because the coefficient of variation is unitless, we can use it instead of the standard deviation to compare the spread of data sets that have different units or different means.\n",
