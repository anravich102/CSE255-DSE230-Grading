Directions for HW5.
===================

The goal of this homework is have students perform data analysis on
unseen real-world data. Find patterns in that data. Identify which
patterns are statistically significant, and write a report to
summarize their work.

The reports will be peer-reviewed, giving the students another
opportunity to see examples of analysis and to critically compare
other students work.

Students are given a set of analysis notebooks numbered 4-7, we they
can use as a starting point to their analysis. However, as students
are analyzing different datasets, they will find different patterns,
and following those pattern should lead them to different types of
analysis. Students are expected to change/add to/create new notebooks.

Based on their analysis the students are to write a report, that
summarizes their findings in clear English. The report should have
only text and figures, no code.

An example report is given.

The submission should include all of the notebooks and the final
report. Review will be based on the report, but reviewers might want
to go back to the notebooks to see the code and/or detailed results.


peer-review
==========
Peer review will be done by pairwise comparisons. Each student will
get 5 pairs of submissions each pair will be for the same data.
Reviewers are expected to read the reports and refer back to the
notebooks when needed.

The reviewer will then fill in the following review form (the actual
form will be a google form).

1. Rigor: Which of the reports used the statistical tools more
rigorously: 1,2, 0 (they have the same rigor)
2. Significance: Which of the reports has better statistical support
for their conclusions? 1,2,0
3. Originality: Which of the reports went further beyond the supplied
notebooks?  1,2,0
4. Presentations: Which of the reports presents the analysis in a
clearer and more convincing way. Consider both writing, figures and
document layout.  1,2,0

You will be graded based both on the reviews you go and on the reviews
you gave.

You can use 0, or equal, when you grade, but if you use a  lot of 0's
your grade as a reviewer will be lower.

The actual formula for assigning a grade for HW5 will be determined
after all of the reviews are in.
