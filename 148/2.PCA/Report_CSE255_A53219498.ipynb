This **agrees** with our previous observation that snowfall across New Mexico varies uniformly [Section 4.1]. Also, this means that the SNWD in New Mexico does not vary much with time, i.e., the snowfall has been consistent over the years.\n",

This is **expected**, as we say in [section 4.2] that variation in precipitation data is complex to capture. We conclude that precipitation has been equally inconsistent in New Mexico across both stations and years, although variation across station is more."
