    "# Washington Weather Pattern Analysis Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we analyse the historical data of weather patterns of an areas that lies in Washington state. The area includes Moses Lake in the northwest and Municipai Airport in the southeast, which is shown in the figure below. As a remark, we point out that in this map, the area of a circle corresponds to the count of stations in that location.\n",
    "\n",
    "![area.png](area.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The weather pattern data used for our analysis can be downloaded from [Data Link](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are six core measurements in our data set: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **PRCP** = Precipitation (tenths of mm)\n",
    "* **SNOW** = Snowfall (mm)\n",
    "* **SNWD** = Snow depth (mm)\n",
    "* **TMAX** = Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)\n",
    "* **TMIN** = Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)\n",
    "* **TOBS** = Temperature at the time of observation (tenths of degrees C)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison with Other Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "** Let us perform some sanity check on our data. The figure below is extracted from the 'US Climate Data' [Website](http://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/moses-lake/washington/united-states/uswa0762).**\n",
    "\n",
    "![source.png](source.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above figure, we can see the maximum/minimum temprature and the precipitation for each month in the Morse Lake area. In the graph below, we plot out the maximum temperature curve and minimum temprature curve based on our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tmm.png](Tmm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, the above curves have the same shape as the curves in the 'US Climate Data' plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we only look at the maximum temperature curve, the peak is reached around July for both plots. Besides, the peak value is 90F in the 'US Climate Data' plot, which is roughly 33C. This is roughly equal to the peak value in our data plot! Thus, our data indeed reflects the true value and can be trusted."

    "It's easy to see that among these six features, SNWD is best explained by the top **10** eigen-vectors, i.e., **96% of the varince is exaplaned by the top 10 eigen-vectors**. However, to select SNWD as the feature to be analysed, we need to make sure that the signal has some meaningful structure. We present the mean+-sd plot of SNWD as a fuction of time. \n",

    "![snwd.png](snwd.png)\n",

    "In the figure above, the orange curve is the mean SNWD signal. Clearly, it is a bowl-shape curve and has value zero in the middle. This makes sense because the temprature goes up to 32C during the middle of the year, and thus there should be no snow. To conclude, we use SNWD as the feature for further analysis."

    "The majority of the pairs have negative log probability values less than 0.3, which correpsonds to a probability value of 0.7408. This means that for most of the station pairs, the null hypothesis is likely to hold. \n",
