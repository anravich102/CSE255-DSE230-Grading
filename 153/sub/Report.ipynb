Why the data for snow can be explained so well? We will reveil this in next part."

The eigenvalues show more concern on non-snow days and they may ignore the expression of snowy days. However, in the data there is no snow on most days, which fits the character of eigenvalues. So they have strong explanations on non-snowy days, which is the most situation."

    "**eig2** and **eig3,eig4** are similar in the following way. They all oscilate between positive and negative values. In other words, they correspond to changing the distribution of the snow depth over the winter months, but they don't change the total (much). And also, **eig2** seems have a opposite trend towards the changes of mean. This may be because it is a kind of opposite symbol of temperature - the higher this value, the low the temperature. **eig3,eig4** looks more complex than others.\n",
