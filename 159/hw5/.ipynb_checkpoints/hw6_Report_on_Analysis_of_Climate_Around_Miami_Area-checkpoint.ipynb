The value is low, which means the variance is spread around each dimentions. Based on these figures and results, I will dig deeper into the PCA analysis for the average temperature."

In other words, it shows that summer season has the peak and high temperature lasts for about 4 months, while through other months the temperture is smoothly changing.\n",
