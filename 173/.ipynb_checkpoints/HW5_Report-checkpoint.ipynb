    "\n",
    "This is a report on the historical analysis of weather patterns in an area that approximately overlaps the area of the state of Utah and Nevada. The area covers several forest parks in mountains. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will use here comes from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). Specifically, it was downloaded from This [FTP site](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We focused on six measurements:\n",
    "* **TMIN, TMAX:** the daily minimum and maximum temperature.\n",
    "* **TOBS:** The average temperature for each day.\n",
    "* **PRCP:** Daily Percipitation (in mm)\n",
    "* **SNOW:** Daily snowfall (in mm)\n",
    "* **SNWD:** The depth of accumulated snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report contains five sections. In the first section, we briefly introduce the analysis area and measurements. In the second section, we do sanity check on provided data. In the third section, we briefly do PCA on these measurements. In the fourth and fifth sections, we will analyze principle components of TOBS and SNWD in detail.\n",

From the data of US Climate Data, we know that the highest maximum temperature is this area is a little above 30 centigrades in July and the highest minimal temperature is about 12 centigrades in Augest, which agrees with our record. Besides, the trend of temperature is similar between these two data source. Thus, we can say that our data for temperature is trustful.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "We conclude that of the three, TOBS is best explained by the top 5 eigenvectors. This is especially true for the first eigen-vector which, by itself, explains 55% of the variance. That is, several top eigenvalues for these three measurement can represent most part of the variance. Thus, we will do some detailed PCA process on TOBS later.\n",

    "The top 5 eigenvectors explain 13% of the variance for PRCP and 11% for SNOW. Both are low values. On the other hand the top 5 eigenvectors explain about 90% of the variance for SNWD. This means that these top 5 eigenvectors capture most of the variation in the snow signals. Based on that we will dig deeper into the PCA analysis for snow-depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes sense that SNWD would be less noisy than SNOW. That is because SNWD is a decaying integral of SNOW and, as such, varies less between days and between the same date on diffferent years."

However, for next 3 coefficients, they mainly varies from year to year instead of station to station. It makes sense. We know that the first eigen-function is the main components of average temperature. Due to the fact that climate varies greatly in mountain areas in a short distance, there should be large difference between common average temperature of stations in difference locations. But it varies slightly among years. Then, for the next three eigen-functions, they mainly stand for an extreme weather. An extreme weather, such as a cold front or a warm air stream, may affect the whole area, but does not come every year."
