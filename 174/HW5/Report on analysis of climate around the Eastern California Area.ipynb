According to our analysis the average rainfall is 1.38 mm/day which translates to about 1.62 Inches&nbsp;per month. According to US-Climate-Data the rainfall varies in the eastern mountain area and wester mountain area, for example, the average rainfall in Yosemite National Park is closer to 2.9 inch per month, while the average rainfall in Tonopah in Nevada is only 0.43 inch per month. The reason is that the eastern mountain area belongs to windward slope and the western area is in leeward slop, the satellite shows there are more vegetation in eastern than than in western. The precipitation of most area is contributed by the precipitation from October to next March.</p>\n",
