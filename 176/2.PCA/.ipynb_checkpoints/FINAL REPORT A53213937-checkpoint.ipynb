    "To answer this question we extract all of the values of `res_3` which is the residual variance after the Mean and the \n",

    "Clearly we can see that around 10% of the instances have res_3 < 0.9 and the remaining have res_3 between 0.9 and 1.0 which proves that most of the variance in data cannot be explained by top eigen vectors.\n",

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "It is likely to be hard to find correlations between the **amount** of rain on the same day in different stations. Because amounts of rain vary a lot between even close locations. It is more reasonable to try to compare whether or not it rained on the same day in different stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### measuring statistical significance\n",
    "We want to find a statistical test for rejecting the null hypothesis that says that the rainfall in the two locations is independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the inner product is too noisy, because you multiply the rainfall on the same day in two locations and that product can be very large - leading to a large variance and poor ability to discriminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to ignore the amount of rain, and just ask whether it rained in both locations. We can then compute the probability associated with the number of overlaps under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we will use the p-test for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will pass the correlation matrix to the p-test and get the significance curve\n",
    "A large value in the significance curve means that there is greater chance that if it rained in one station then it will also rain in another station.\n",
    "\n",
    "![PRCP_significance.png](Analysis/PRCP_significance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above we notice that a lot of pairs of stations have low significance value which means that their rainfall patterns on a day are correlated.\n",

    "Finding structure in the rependency matrix.\n",

    "The matrix above shows, for each pair of stations, the normalized log probability that the overlap in rain days is random.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see immediately the first few  stations are highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find more correlations we use SVD (the term PCA is reserved for decomposition of the covariance matrix). As we shall see that the top 10 eigenvectors explain about 80% of the square magnitude of the matrix.\n",

    "When we reorder the rows and columns of the matrix using one of the eigenvectors, the grouping of the stations becomes more evident. For example, consider the upper left corner of the scond matrix (The upper left one). The stations at positions 0-22 are clearly strongly correlated with each other. Even though there are some stations, in positions 15-18 or so, which are more related to each other than to the rest of this block.\n",
