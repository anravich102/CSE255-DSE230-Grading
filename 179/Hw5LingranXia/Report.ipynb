    "The top 5 eigenvectors explain 7.3% of the variance for PRCP and 12.5% for SNOW. Both are low values. On the other hand the top 5 eigenvectors explain 85% of the variance for SNWD. This means that these top 5 eigenvectors capture most of the variation in the snow signals. Based on that we will dig deeper into the PCA analysis for snow-depth.\n",

    "This is because coeff_1 reflects the total snowfall for the station and serves as the base coefficient. Thus, although the snowfall may vary from year to year, it is not suprising that the snowfall vary from station to station, and the location factor plays a more important role. However, the rest of the coefficient reflect the timing of the snowfall. When a cold wave comes, it will influence a large number of stations, so all the stations we observe the same trend in snowfall changes. However, the time when there comes a cold wave vary from year to year. Thus, the variation by year explains more than the variation by station for coeff2, coeff3 and coeff4. "
